# SQL-BAMAZON
Homework assignment for FULL-STACK BOOTCAMP for integrating SQL databases and testing with products.

The Bamozon Project is based off a SQL database. I intergrated this database by making a store based off require("console.table") to give the user a more fiendly experience. 
I intergrated inquirer and the method inquirer.prompt to ask the user the ID number they would like to purchase from and the quality. 
Then based on the user output the UPDATE method in SQL, updated the databased based on the user's choice for purchase. 

Please see screenshots below for the example.
